Turned 21 years old and felt the urge to prepare for a half marathon (21.1km). **No** previous running experience besides playing football and basketball.

### **Initial Prediction: Sub-2:00 hrs. **

A whole year for preparation felt like a lot. And for the goal i had, it definitely was.

After trying to figure out the perfect running routine and weekly structure to stick to, i decided to just start. On hindisght, that was the best decision. Started doing 5 to 20 min runs almost everyday at a very slow pace. When finishing, my lower back hurt and legs were sore.

With time, I started easing into it. The challenging task became a fun habit. What felt like a burden became a must. Without realizing, running became an almost daily habit. Simultaneously, I started learning a lot: zone 2, training volume, fueling and running economy stopped stopped sounfding like nonsense to me.

After 5 to 6 months in, i was averaging 20/30km every week. Mainly consisting of easy runs, a "long" run in the weekend and a shorter fast effort once every 2 weeks.
I realized i was getting fitter, and that provided enough motivation to continue training.

I kept things pretty simple and bumped my training up to 50/60 km for the last 2/3 months before the event. My zone 2 pace increased from like 6:45 min/km to 5:45 min/km and my VO2Max reached almost 60 mL/kg/min (_Apple Watch measurements_). Progress was notable!

### **Race Day Prediction: Sub-1:45 hrs. **

By race day i was certain i could hold up a 5 min/km pace. My initial prediction was an underestimation of both my discipline and of how much can be done in a year.

When finishing, i knew that was only the first of many races. For running, consistency goes a very long way.
If i can only recommend some things:

- Keep it simple, just get out there.
- Dont focus on pace, time on feet is a better metric (at least certainly for beginners).
- Enjoy and dont stress about it.
