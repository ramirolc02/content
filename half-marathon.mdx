On my 21st birthday, I decided to challenge myself. A half marathon (21.1km) called my name. With **no** prior long distance running experience, I commited to it.

### Initial Prediction: Sub-2:00 hrs.

A whole year for preparation felt like a lot. Looking back, given my initial goal, it certainly was.

After trying to figure out the perfect running routine and weekly structure, I did the unexpected...and simply started running. In hindsight, that was the best decision. Just starting with 5 to 20 min runs almost everyday at a very slow pace set me up for success, and some pain. My lower back ached and leg soreness increased.

As time passed, I began easing into it. The challenging task evolved into a fun habit. What felt like a burden, became a must. Without realizing, running became an almost daily habit. Simultaneously, Iwas making sense of all these "crucial" (and deeply unfamiliar) concepts like Zone 2, training volume and running economy.

### Training Progress

Five to six months in, I was consistently logging 20/30km weekly. The routine mainly consisted of easy runs, a "long" run on the weekends and a shorter fast effort once every 2 weeks. I realized I was getting fitter, and that provided enough motivation to continue.

I kept things pretty simple and gradually bumped my training up to 50/60 km for the last 2-3 months before the event. Progress was notable:

- My zone 2 pace increased from 6:45 min/km to 5:45 min/km.
- My VO2Max increased 10 points, reaching almost 60 mL/kg/min (_Apple Watch measurements_).

### Race Day Prediction: Sub-1:45 hrs.

By race day I was certain I could hold up a 5 min/km pace. My initial prediction had greatly underestimated both my discipline and the potential for improvement in the given timeframe.

When finishing, I knew that was only the first of many races. For running, consistency goes a very long way.

## Key Takeaways:

- Keep it simple- just get out there and run.
- Don´t obsess over pace, time on feet is a much better metric, especially as a beginner.
- Enjoy, keep running and repeat.
