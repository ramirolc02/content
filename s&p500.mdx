I'm a Spanish investor and I want to get exposure to the S&P500. What are my options?

After some research, best options are: 

* Buy CFD without owning underlying asset: Easily get them in every broker platform. Tickers like VOO or SPY are the most common.
* Buy UCITS ETF that replicates S&P500: This is the best option for long-term investors. Tickers like VUSA or CSPX are the most common.

Both have 15% taxes on dividends depending on where you are based. Total expense Ratios tend to be lower with CFDs.
